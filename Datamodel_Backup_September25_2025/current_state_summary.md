# Current Data Model State - September 25, 2025

## Working Features
✅ Intent Match Bonus System - Users get correct prioritization when asking for specific products
✅ Domain Vocabulary Weighting - Enhanced embedding generation
✅ Trinity Relationship Creation - Fixed multi-PowerSource logic
✅ F-GIN Product Assignment - Renegade correctly maps to F000000007/F000000005

## Current Data Structure
- **Transactions**: 10,087 (acting as line items)
- **Products**: 248 
- **Trinity Relationships**: 11,087 (Transaction → Product relationships)
- **Unique Trinity Combinations**: 19

## Known Issues
❌ Still getting wrong feeder/cooler in recommendations (RobustFeed/COOL2 instead of F-GINs)
❌ Trinity relationships not being used by recommendation system
❌ Messy data model (Transaction as line item is confusing)

## Trinity Example (Renegade)
- Trinity ID: "0445250880_F000000007_F000000005"  
- PowerSource: Renegade ES 300i Kit w/welding cables
- Feeder: F000000007 "No Feeder Available"
- Cooler: F000000005 "No Cooler Available"
- Database Relations: 201 relationships (67 transactions × 3 components)

## Database Backup Location
- Schema: current_schema.txt
- Relationships: current_relationships.txt  
- Node Counts: current_node_counts.txt
- Relationship Counts: current_relationship_counts.txt
- Source Data: neo4j_datasets_backup/, neo4jdatasets_backup/
- Loader Code: loaders_backup/

## Restoration Instructions
1. Restore source data from backup folders
2. Restore loader code from loaders_backup/
3. Run: `python load_data.py` to recreate database
4. Verify Trinity relationships and intent match bonus functionality

## Next Steps
Design new clean architecture with:
- Order header nodes
- Proper Trinity nodes with semantic search capability
- Clean relationship structure
