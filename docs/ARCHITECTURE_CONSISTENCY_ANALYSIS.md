## **üö® Potential Handshake Issues & Resolutions**

### **Issue 1: Mode Detection Threshold Consistency**
```yaml
Problem: Agent architecture defines thresholds, service needs exact values

Resolution:
  Agent Architecture: expert_score > 0.7 ‚Üí EXPERT_MODE
  Service Architecture: confidence > 0.8 ‚Üí GRAPH_FOCUSED
  
Fix: Align thresholds
  - Mode detection: expert_score > 0.7 ‚Üí EXPERT_MODE
  - Strategy selection: expertise_mode == "EXPERT" AND confidence > 0.7 ‚Üí GRAPH_FOCUSED
```

### **Issue 2: Graph Algorithm Selection**
```yaml
Problem: Agent architecture mentions centrality, service marks as optional

Resolution: 
  - Keep shortest_path: ‚úÖ REQUIRED (compatibility chains)
  - Keep pagerank: ‚úÖ REQUIRED (popular products)  
  - Make centrality: ‚ö†Ô∏è OPTIONAL (implement if time allows)
  - Skip clustering: ‚ùå NOT NEEDED (confirmed unnecessary)
```

### **Issue 3: Error Handling Consistency**
```yaml
Problem: Agent architecture focuses on logic, service needs enterprise error handling

Resolution:
  - Add consistent error handling across all agents
  - Ensure trace_id propagation for observability
  - Implement graceful degradation when components fail
```
